# Task: Web Audio API Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive Web Audio API integration for microphone input capture, audio processing, and playback functionality. This provides the browser-side audio pipeline that captures user voice input and plays AI responses with high-quality, low-latency audio processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Microphone permission handling and user consent flow
- [ ] Real-time audio capture using getUserMedia()
- [ ] PCM16 audio format conversion from Float32
- [ ] Audio playback system for AI responses
- [ ] Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for speech detection
- [ ] Audio visualization with real-time waveform display
- [ ] Audio device selection and configuration
- [ ] Echo cancellation and noise suppression

## Technical Details
### Audio Pipeline Architecture
```
User Voice → getUserMedia() → AudioContext → ScriptProcessor → PCM16 → WebSocket
AI Response ← Audio Playback ← Base64 Decode ← WebSocket
```

### Core Components
```typescript
class AudioManager {
  private audioContext: AudioContext;
  private mediaStream: MediaStream;
  private processor: ScriptProcessorNode;
  private analyser: AnalyserNode;
  
  async requestMicrophoneAccess()
  startRecording(): Promise<void>
  stopRecording(): void
  playAudioResponse(audioData: string)
  getAudioVisualization(): Uint8Array
}

class VoiceActivityDetector {
  detectSpeech(audioData: Float32Array): boolean
  private calculateRMS(samples: Float32Array): number
  private applyNoiseGate(level: number): boolean
}
```

### Audio Configuration
- **Sample Rate**: 24000 Hz (OpenAI Realtime API requirement)
- **Channels**: Mono (1 channel)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit PCM
- **Buffer Size**: 2048 samples for low latency
- **VAD Threshold**: -40dB for speech detection

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with Web Audio API support
- HTTPS requirement for microphone access
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Development environment with TypeScript
- [ ] HTTPS development server for microphone access
- [ ] Modern browser with Web Audio API support

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: M (Medium)
- **Hours**: 8-16 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent from OpenAI integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Microphone access permission flow implemented
- [ ] Real-time audio capture working consistently
- [ ] PCM16 conversion producing correct format
- [ ] Audio playback system working smoothly
- [ ] Voice Activity Detection accurately detecting speech
- [ ] Audio visualization showing real-time waveforms
- [ ] Device selection allowing microphone/speaker choice
- [ ] Echo cancellation reducing feedback loops
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing completed
- [ ] Audio quality meets performance requirements (< 100ms latency)
- [ ] Error handling for permission denied and device failures
- [ ] Unit tests for audio processing functions
