# Voice Button Component

## Description

Build an animated voice button component with a state machine that handles idle, connecting, and active states. The button should provide visual feedback for voice interaction states and smooth transitions between different modes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create animated voice button with multiple visual states
- [ ] Implement state machine: idle → connecting → active
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between states with CSS animations
- [ ] Handle click events for voice activation/deactivation
- [ ] Provide visual feedback for microphone access states
- [ ] Support keyboard accessibility (spacebar activation)
- [ ] Display appropriate icons for each state
- [ ] Implement pulse/breathing animation for active state

## Technical Details

### Component Structure
```jsx
<VoiceButton
  state="idle" | "connecting" | "active"
  onToggle={() => {}}
  disabled={false}
  size="large" | "medium" | "small"
/>
```

### State Machine
- **Idle**: Default state, ready to start recording
- **Connecting**: Requesting microphone permissions
- **Active**: Currently recording audio

### Animation Requirements
- Smooth state transitions (0.3s duration)
- Pulse animation for active state
- Loading spinner for connecting state
- Hover effects for interactive feedback

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Focus indicators

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: UI Foundation (theming, base components)
- **Task 003**: Audio Input System (voice recording state)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (1-2 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Component structure and props: 2 hours
- State machine implementation: 3 hours
- CSS animations and transitions: 4 hours
- Accessibility features: 2 hours
- Testing and refinement: 3 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Voice button component created with all three states
- [ ] State machine properly handles transitions
- [ ] All animations are smooth and performant
- [ ] Click handling works correctly
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Component is responsive across screen sizes
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated with component usage
