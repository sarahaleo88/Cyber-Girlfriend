# Task: OpenAI Realtime API Integration

## Description
Implement the core WebSocket proxy server that connects to OpenAI's Realtime API for real-time voice conversations. This is the critical foundation that enables all AI conversation functionality, handling bidirectional audio streaming, session management, and error recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket server established using Bun + Hono framework
- [ ] OpenAI Realtime API connection and authentication working
- [ ] Bidirectional audio streaming (PCM16 format) implemented
- [ ] Session lifecycle management (create, maintain, close)
- [ ] Error handling and automatic reconnection logic
- [ ] Audio format conversion (browser audio → PCM16 → OpenAI)
- [ ] Rate limiting and connection throttling
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for API keys

## Technical Details
### Implementation Approach
- **WebSocket Proxy Pattern**: Client connects to our server, server proxies to OpenAI
- **Audio Pipeline**: Browser MediaStream → PCM16 → Base64 → OpenAI Realtime API
- **Session Management**: Handle connection state, heartbeat, and graceful disconnection
- **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern

### Key Components
```typescript
class RealtimeProxy {
  private openaiWs: WebSocket;
  private clientWs: WebSocket;
  private sessionId: string;
  
  async connect(apiKey: string, config: SessionConfig)
  async handleAudioStream(audioData: ArrayBuffer)
  async handleDisconnection()
  private reconnect(attempts: number)
}
```

### API Configuration
- **Model**: gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01
- **Audio Format**: PCM16, 24kHz, mono
- **Instructions**: Dynamic based on selected personality
- **Voice**: Configurable (alloy, echo, fable, nova, shimmer)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Development environment setup
- [ ] OpenAI API key with Realtime API access
- [ ] SSL certificate for WebSocket connections

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 16-24 hours
- **Parallel**: false (critical path dependency)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WebSocket server handles client connections
- [ ] OpenAI Realtime API integration working end-to-end
- [ ] Audio streaming in both directions (user → AI → user)
- [ ] Session management with proper cleanup
- [ ] Error handling covers network failures and API errors
- [ ] Reconnection logic tested and working
- [ ] API rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Unit tests for core proxy functionality
- [ ] Documentation for API endpoints and WebSocket protocol
