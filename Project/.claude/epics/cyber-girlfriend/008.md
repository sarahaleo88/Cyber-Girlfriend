# PWA & Deployment

## Description

Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality and deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers with edge optimization. This includes service worker implementation, offline support, app installation capabilities, and production deployment configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement service worker for caching and offline functionality
- [ ] Create web app manifest for PWA installation
- [ ] Enable offline mode with cached conversations
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare Workers deployment
- [ ] Set up edge optimization for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Implement app installation prompts and handling
- [ ] Add push notification support for conversation updates
- [ ] Configure production environment variables and secrets

## Technical Details

### Service Worker Features
```javascript
// sw.js - Service Worker implementation
- Cache static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Cache API responses for conversations
- Offline fallback pages
- Background sync for pending messages
- Push notification handling
```

### Web App Manifest
```json
{
  "name": "Cyber Girlfriend AI",
  "short_name": "CyberGF",
  "description": "AI voice companion with real-time conversation",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "theme_color": "#6366f1",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Cloudflare Workers Configuration
```javascript
// wrangler.toml
name = "cyber-girlfriend"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"
main = "./dist/worker.js"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "WEBSOCKET_SESSIONS"
class_name = "WebSocketSession"

[vars]
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

### Offline Capabilities
- Cache recent conversations for offline viewing
- Queue outgoing messages when offline
- Background sync when connection restored
- Offline indicator in UI
- Cached personality presets

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Build optimization**: Bundle splitting, tree shaking, compression
2. **Asset optimization**: Image compression, WebP conversion
3. **Edge deployment**: Cloudflare Workers with global distribution
4. **WebSocket handling**: Durable Objects for session management
5. **SSL/TLS**: Automatic HTTPS with Cloudflare certificates

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Code splitting by route
- Preload critical resources
- CDN caching for static assets
- Gzip compression for text assets

### Security Configuration
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Environment variable encryption
- API key rotation capabilities
- Rate limiting at edge

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: UI Foundation (complete frontend build)
- **Task 002**: Core AI Integration (API endpoints and WebSocket)
- **Task 004**: Voice Button Component (main interaction)
- **Task 005**: Conversation Interface (core user experience)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (1-2 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Service worker implementation: 4 hours
- Web app manifest and PWA setup: 2 hours
- Offline functionality: 3 hours
- Cloudflare Workers configuration: 3 hours
- Build optimization and deployment: 3 hours
- Push notifications setup: 2 hours
- Testing and performance tuning: 3 hours
