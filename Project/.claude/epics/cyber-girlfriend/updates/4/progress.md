# Task #4 Progress Update

**Task**: Web Audio API Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive Web Audio API integration for microphone input capture, audio processing, and playback functionality. This provides the browser-side audio pipeline for the AI voice companion with professional-grade features and cross-browser compatibility.

## Completed Deliverables

### ✅ 1. Microphone Capture System
- **File**: `frontend/src/services/audioManager.ts`
- getUserMedia() integration with comprehensive permission handling
- Real-time audio capture with proper buffering (2048 samples, low latency)
- PCM16 format conversion from Float32 for OpenAI Realtime API
- Audio device selection and configuration support
- Robust error handling for all permission scenarios

### ✅ 2. Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Components**: ScriptProcessorNode, AnalyserNode, GainNode, MediaStreamAudioSourceNode
- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with adaptive thresholding (-40dB default)
- Echo cancellation and noise suppression enabled
- Real-time frequency and time-domain analysis
- Microphone gain control (0.1x - 2.0x range)

### ✅ 3. Audio Playback System
- **Method**: `playAudioResponse(audioData: string)`
- Base64 audio decoding and format handling
- Low-latency playback with minimal buffering via AudioContext
- Volume control for AI responses (0.8x default)
- Cross-browser compatibility with fallback support

### ✅ 4. Audio Visualization Components
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/VoiceVisualizer.tsx`
- Real-time waveform display with configurable bar count
- Frequency domain and time domain visualization modes
- Speech detection visual indicators (green/red/blue states)
- RMS level display and smooth Framer Motion animations

### ✅ 5. Device Selection and Configuration
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/AudioSettings.tsx`
- Modal-based settings interface with device enumeration
- Microphone and speaker selection dropdowns
- Real-time audio level monitoring with visual feedback
- Gain and VAD threshold slider controls
- Device refresh and permission status indicators

### ✅ 6. React Integration
- **Hook**: `frontend/src/hooks/useAudio.ts` - Complete React integration
- **Store**: Extended Zustand store with audio state management
- **Types**: Extended TypeScript interfaces for audio features
- Seamless integration with existing component architecture

## Technical Specifications Met
